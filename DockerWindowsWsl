Baixe o docker para windows:
https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/

Após isso, siga passo a passo do software (instalação padrão)

Após isso, inicie o aplicativo do docker e vamos testar em nosso Power Shell ou cmd:

- docker run hello-world
Deve aparecer esta mensagem: 

Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from library/hello-world

Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash
